PNumber.js
	-Changed type of string accepted by verifyNumber algorithm => 
	 from (xxx)-xxx-xxxx to (xxx) xxx-xxxx, with no space between 
	 the closing parenthesis and the digit following accepted and 
	 immediately corrected. Refactored verifyNumber(), while I 
	 previously used manual string matching, I now use regular 
	 expressions.
	-Don't allow characters other than digits within 'x' fields	
	-Wrote new method: removeFormattingFromNumber(), takes as input 
	 a phone number, removes the whitespace, all parenthesis, and 
	 the single dash. 
Client-Form:
	-Phone Number retrieval: phone numbers are retrieved and 
	 displayed with the new format.
	-Ported Number Text-Fields: Text-fields for bothNumbers and 
	 portedNumbers use the new verifyNumber algorithm.
Staff-Form:
	-Corrected small issue where modifying a feature would not save
	 changes.
