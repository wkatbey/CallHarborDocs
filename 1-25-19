-Created new searching algoritm for transaction database. Allows user to type in value and recieve multiple matching
inputs

-Created new algorithm to retrieve phone numbers, and extract only the phone numbers that were specified for the user's
current type (i.e. ported, created, both) rather than display all of them. 

-Corrected bug that hid phone-numbers table in the transaction database when the user is both porting and creating numbers

-The following process is successful: 
	-Creating an order
	-Using order pin to configure data on client-side
	-Select 'Porting Numbers'
	-Submit data
	-
