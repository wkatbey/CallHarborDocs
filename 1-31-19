Client-Form:
-Corrected the following bugs: Set location question to 'single location', refresh the page, then set to 'multiple locations'. 
The Locations tab will not display the multiple locations view. Additionally, clicking on an option without hitting 'next' 
will prevent the question data from being sent to the database. 
-Phone number retrieval is now handled by PhoneNumbersAPI.js. Retrieving a list of numbers, and loading a number into the list 
are all successful.
-User enters area code and selects a phone number. Once the user clicks the number purpose text box, the area code and phone 
number fields are no longer cleared, unless the Toll-Free option is selected. 
-Redesigned Area Code, Phone Number, & Location fields. Placed them in the same row.
-Both-Numbers Tab: 
	--Deleting a phone number will delete the phone number in the database. 
	--Whether or not a number is ported is recognized when editing the phone 
	number. This information is saved 
	and retrieved from the database.
	--Saving or adding a record will uncheck the "I'm 
	porting this number" checkbox 
	--The fields that are irrelevant to created numbers are marked with 
	"N/A". This occurs when the user creates the numbers, and the info is 
	sent to and loaded from the database.
	--Corrected bug: Ported number locations are always retrieved from the 
	database. Used number.location.id rather than locationID. 
-Corrected bug: Switching to new numbers, refreshing, and switching 
back to 'both' numbers would leave the carrier and account number fields 
empty. The fields are visible now.  
-Redesigned extensions table, carriers table, and all (functional) phone number tables. Made the tables bordered and striped. Replaced 'edit' with a pencil icon and
'delete' with a red 'X' icon. Added a thick border between each individual carrier listed. Fixed a bug, the pin column was 
being displayed upon refreshing, editing, and saving of a carrier without any pin information. Didn't account for pin values 
of 'null' (I may be wrong here. I may have to revisit in the future)

-I've noticed a new bug. For the time being, if I've decided to port numbers, order them, or both, I'll stick to that option. Switching between them may mess
with the invidual columns of each tab when I refresh the page. Nonetheless, this will be taken care of, so long as I know where the source is. All types of phone numbers
interlap in $scope.loadPhoneNumbersFromDatabase. Take a look there.

-Order the numbers created in the both numbers tab. Hasn't been tested, 
and no regression test has been performed on ordering new numbers.
