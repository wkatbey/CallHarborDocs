Staff-Form
-Re-designed archive database, to resemble transaction database
-Deletion of transaction from transaction database results in deletion of that
 record in database
-User can edit order items, save changes, updates record in database
-Changed color of headings on verify client form
-Added 'edit' and 'delete' icons for modify users form
-Deletion of transaction from database results in deletion of all client records connected to
that transaction's pin
-If user deletes all phone types, features, or hardware, the table will no longer display. Rather,
a message indicating the list is empty is displayed
-User deletes hardware, and the hardware is deleted from the database. Didn't work due to a typo in
save_order_tech.php
-Added button that generates a random, unique, four digit pin

Client-Form
-Billing accounts form displays correctly upon first login. The application attempted 
to retrieve 'showForm' from a table where a record, with the user's pin, didn't initially 
exit, thereby hiding the form upon first login.
-When a transaction is deleted, doesn't allow user to log in using that pin
-When a transaction is deleted, when user refreshes, they're logged out of form, and
the company info on the navbar doens't appear (i.e. isLoggedIn is set to false)
-Billing account email and phone number are verified, and user is not allowed to add
the billing account to the table if they aren't valid
